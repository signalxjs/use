# Contributing to SignalX use

Thanks for your interest! This repo is part of the
[`signalxjs`](https://github.com/signalxjs) family. It follows the **sigx
standard** working setup — agent guide, git-worktree flow, CI/release pipeline,
and protected `main` — maintained in
[`signalxjs/repo-template`](https://github.com/signalxjs/repo-template).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`
- **pnpm** `>=10` (this repo uses workspaces; `npm` and `yarn` are not supported)

## Getting started

We use the standard `main` / `branches` worktree layout. Clone the primary
checkout into a `main` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/signalxjs/use.git use/main
cd use/main
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

> The `build` step is required before tests when packages consume each other's
> `dist/` output through the workspace.

## Working on a change

Create an isolated worktree instead of switching branches in place:

```bash
pnpm wt new my-change      # checkout at <repo>/branches/my-change, deps installed
cd ../branches/my-change
```

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the full worktree flow (it's the same for
people and agents). **Never commit on `main`** — it's protected and shared by
parallel checkouts.

## Common tasks

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `pnpm build` |
| Run tests | `pnpm test` |
| Tests in watch mode | `pnpm test:watch` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` |

## Pre-push checklist

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## Pull request guidelines

- **Keep PRs small and focused.** One logical change per PR.
- **Reference an issue** if one exists; otherwise describe the motivation in the PR body.
- **Add tests.** New behaviour gets tests. **Fix bugs test-first:** add a unit test that *fails* because of the bug, then fix until it's green (red → green). If you spot behaviour that should be covered but isn't, add the missing tests in the same PR.
- **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** under the `[Unreleased]` section (for user-visible changes).
- **Update docs in the same PR.** Package/script/API changes update the in-repo docs (see `AGENTS.md` → Documentation); user-facing changes also need an issue filed on the docs repo [`signalxjs/signalxjs.github.io`](https://github.com/signalxjs/signalxjs.github.io) before merge, linked from the PR body — the docs agent picks it up from there (don't open docs-site PRs yourself).
- **Don't bump versions** in your PR — releases are handled centrally via tags.
- **Squash-merge only.** `main` rejects merge commits; CI must be green and the
  PR reviewed before merge.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

- **Bug?** Open an issue with the [bug report template](https://github.com/signalxjs/use/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). A minimal reproduction helps a lot.
- **Feature idea?** Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/signalxjs/use/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
